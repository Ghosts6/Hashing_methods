# Hashing :
hash function is a mathematical algorithm that takes an input  and produces output as a fixed-size string of characters, which is typically a hexadecimal or binary representation. This output is known as the hash value or hash code.
now a days we have differend hashing method like md5 ssha sha-1 sha-256 bycrypt and if we want to rank them based on security: ðŸ¥‡bycrypt ðŸ¥ˆsha-256 ðŸ¥‰ssha  
# bycrypt :

# sha-256 :

# ssha :

# sha-1 :

# md5 :
